    <img src="../img/lasagna.jpg" alt="Picture of the final product(lasagna)" height="310" width="310">
    <p>Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. 
        It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, 
        made from a dough based on flour and eggs, <br>
        with numerous local variants.<br>
    </p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li> Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
