    <h2> Steps for making pizza</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your pizza dough recipe or on the packaging.</li>

            <li>Prepare Pizza Dough: If you're making your own dough, follow a recipe or use a pre-made dough. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>

            <li> Prepare Toppings: Chop or slice your chosen toppings into bite-sized pieces. If using meat, make sure it's cooked before putting it on the pizza.</li>

            <li>Assemble Pizza: Place the rolled-out dough onto a pizza stone or baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Spread pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust. Sprinkle cheese evenly over the sauce, then add your desired toppings.</li>

            <li> Bake: Carefully transfer the assembled pizza into the preheated oven. Bake according to the dough recipe or package instructions, usually around 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>

            <li>Cool and Serve: Once baked, remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. This allows the cheese to set slightly and makes it easier to cut. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>




        </ul>
        <h3> Note</h3>
        Remember, you can customize your pizza with different sauces, cheeses, and toppings to suit your taste preferences. Experiment with different combinations to find your favorite!
