    <h2> Steps for making pasta</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li> Fill a large saucepan with water, put the lid on and bring to the boil over a high heat.</li>
            <li> Add a good pinch of sea salt.</li>
            <li> Once the water is boiling, stir in the pasta.</li>
            <li> Cook the pasta according to the packet instructions. To tell if your pasta is cooked, try a piece about a minute or so before the end of the cooking time.
                It's ready when it's soft enough to eat, but still has a bit of bite. The Italians say 'al dente'.</li>
            <li> Drain the pasta in a colander over the sink. Now it's ready to toss through your favourite sauce - it's best to do this in the pan, adding splashes of cooking water and mixing as you go until your sauce coats the pasta and is the perfect consistency.</li>
            




        </ul>
        There are Several choice's of sauce after this we shall go with Pasta peperonata
        <h3> Pasta peperonata Step's</h3>
        <ul>
            
            <li> Deseed and slice the peppers and put them in a large frying pan over a medium heat with a little olive oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Place a lid on, and cook slowly for 15 minutes until softened. Don't rush this too much, as cooking the peppers slowly like this really helps to bring out the flavour.</li>
            <li> While the peppers are cooking, peel and finely slice the onion, and peel and grate the garlic. Finely chop the parsley leaves and reserve the stalks.</li>
            <li> Add the onion to the pan and cook for a further 20 minutes. Then add the garlic and parsley stalks and toss around, keeping everything moving in the pan. Cook for about 3 minutes most. Have a little taste, and season with a bit more salt and pepper. Add the vinegar - it will sizzle away, so give everything a good toss.</li>
            <li> Grate the Parmesan and add one handful of the Parmesan and the mascarpone or crème fraîche, if using, and turn the heat down to minimum while you cook the pasta.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, put a large pot of salted water on to boil. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook according to the packet instructions. When cooked, drain in a colander, reserving some of the cooking water.</li>
            <li> Put the peppers, pasta and parsley leaves into a large warmed bowl. Give them a good toss together, then add a little of the pasta cooking water and a few good lugs of extra virgin olive oil to coat the pasta nicely. Serve straight away sprinkled with the rest of the Parmesan.</li>
